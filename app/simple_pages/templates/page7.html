                <p>
                    <strong>OOP (Object Oriented Programming)</strong>, as the name implies, is a programming
                    paradigm that utilizes objects and classes into programming. The main concepts of Object-
                    Oriented Programming are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Classes</li>
                    <li>Objects</li>
                    <li>Polymorphism</li>
                    <li>Encapsulation</li>
                    <li>Inheritance</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Polymorphism</h1>
                <p>
                    Polymorphism allows for a child class to have the same methods as their parent classes,
                    but used for different types. Unlike inheritance, where a child class can just utilize the same
                    class as their parent, polymorphism allows that same method to be modified in the child class.
                    This is also known as <strong>method overwriting.</strong>

                <h1>Encapsulation</h1>
                <p>
                    Encapsulation is the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on the
                    data within one unit. This restricts the accessibility of variables and methods, preventing the
                    accidental modification of data. Object's variables can only be changed by an object's method.
                    The calculator program utilizes encapsulation in this manner, making sure that no object can directly
                    access another object or its data.

                <h1>Abstraction</h1>
                <p>
                    Abstraction is a concept utilized in order to hide the internal functionality
                    of a program from users. For example, people don't think of an automobile as
                    a set of thousands of moving parts working together, rather, they think of it
                    as one object with its own behavior, which is driving.
                    The calculator program utilizes abstraction by importing the operations package from
                    the operations directory. The calculator class does not to the calculations itself, rather
                    it is the classes within the operations package that are called upon in the calculator program.

                <h1>Inheritance</h1>
                <p>
                    Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits/has all the methods and properties from
                    another class. The newly created class is known as the <i>child</i> class, and the original
                    class derived from is the <i>parent</i> class. Along with the original methods, new methods may
                    also be included within the child class.
                    When the calculator class imports the operations package, it inherits all the methods that
                    the package uses.
